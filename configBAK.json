The Lambda function verifies the jwt against the key from the Okta authorization server's well-known endpoint, constructs an AWS access policy dynamically, and sends the results back to the Gateway. If the policy contains the appropriate grants for the endpoint being requested, the Gateway passes the request on to the target API endpoint.",
