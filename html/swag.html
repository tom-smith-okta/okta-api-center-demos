<h4>Okta + Software AG</h4>

<p>In this example, Software AG is proxying the a "solar system" API hosted on heroku. Software AG has a deep OAuth2 integration with Okta described <a href="http://techcommunity.softwareag.com/web/guest/pwiki/-/wiki/Main/Securing+APIs+using+thirdparty+OAuth2+identity+provider+in+API+Gateway">here</a>.</p>

<p>This demo is just showing Software AG's jwt validation capabilities. The Software AG API gateway is checking the structural validity and signature of the access token, but is not inspecting scopes or other fields within the jwt.</p>

<p>Inspecting the access token at the API level is not included in this API gateway demo.</p>

<p>So, you can click on either user to authenticate. If you attempt to access the planets endpoint or the moons endpoint without an access token, you will get an error. However, if you get an access token as either user you will be able to access both endpoints.</p>
